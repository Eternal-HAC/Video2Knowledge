# PROJECT_STATUS

## 2026-07-05

Status: Stage 1 initialization in progress.

Current goal:

- Establish the Video2Knowledge project structure.
- Implement a standard-library Mock MVP pipeline.
- Validate the CLI and unit tests locally.

Current implementation:

- No real API integrations.
- No external Python dependencies.
- Mock pipeline only.

Known constraints:

- `output/` is generated runtime data and should not be committed.
- Real video, transcript, Whisper, LLM, Notion, Feishu, MCP, and browser extension work is deferred.

## 2026-07-05

Status: Stage 2 interface groundwork started.

Changes:

- Added a platform adapter boundary for URL/local source classification.
- Added transcript result metadata for future fallback strategy.
- Kept all providers Mock-only.
- Added explicit non-Mock provider placeholders that fail with clear not-implemented errors.

Validation target:

- Unit tests must still pass.
- Existing Mock CLI command must remain compatible.
